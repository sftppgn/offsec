MS recommnds kerberos, if not available then ntlmv2 or ntlm
AD based on ldap
ldap based on earlier version of x.500
kerberos used in AD and unix "realms" - mutual auth, 
kerb 5 requires systems to be time syncd within 5 min - limits replay attacks to 5 min
kerb uses db - AD in MS but could be anything
kerb uses symmetric encryption
tacacs is cisco proprietary
pap - cleartext
chap - handshake, server challenges client, uses hashed shared secret with nonce - number used once

5.4
CIRT - cyber incident response team
incident response:

remote sys
archive media

chain of custody - record of everyone in contact with physical asset collected as evidence
legal hold - court order to maintain data as evidence

data acqusition

take hashes and verify them

iv - initialization vector - attack attempts to discover psk - WEP
steganography - hiding things in things, security by obscurity
ECC - elliptic curve cryptography - used by small devices, takes less processing power, depricated
asymmetric - public and private keys, requires PKI to issue certs, pub key decrypted by matching private and vice versa - DH
stream cipher crypto 1 bit at a time
static key semi-permanent - RSA, 
ephemeral -  public/private key pairs
perfect forward secrecy - random pub keys gend without a deterministic algorithm, no key reuse, used by ephemeral keys

key stretching - salting pws with random bits to make them more complex - bcrypt and "PBKDF2" are examples
bcrypt used for /etc/shadow
argon2 recommended over pbkdf2
crypto service provider is software library distributed in crypto modules which can be hardware software or firmware
symmetric algorithms - aes, des, 3des, rc4
asymmetric - box example, i sent you a box with a public key, i have the private key
asymmetric algorithms - rsa, dsa, DH, pgp/gpg
DHE/EDH - diffie-hellman ephemeral, diff keys for each session
ECDHE - elliptic curve difie-hellman, static keys

pgp uses rsa with pub/priv keys, it uses both asymmetric and symmetric crypto
asymmetric crypto used for they key exchange, then symmetric to encrypt data

hmac - hash based message auth code - adds an authenticity check/secret key to hash

ripemd - race integrity primitives evaluation message digest
xor - 2 inputs same = 0 diff =1
confusion - crypto makes ciphertext significantly different
diffusion - small changes in plaintext make large changes in crypto

ccmp - cipher block chaining message auth protocol - encryption used by wpa2
ccmp is based on aes
wpa2 enterprise mode uses 802.1x radius
auth protocols
eap - pairwise master key PMK - use key to encrypt data, tkip and aes-based ccmp use this
eap-fast - secure tunneling - optional certs, replacement for leap
peap - protected eap - eap with TLS tunnel, requires server cert, common with mschapv2
eap-ttls - tunnelled TLS - extension of peap, can be used with older auth methods like PAP
eap-tls - secure and widely implemented, diff btwn peap and this is that we need client certs too
radius federation - 2 entities/companies sharing ID mgmt system
wps attacks try different PINs until it works - reaver is 1 open source tol used for this, in 10 hours or quicker

captive portals - forcing clients to login/accept terms before using browser

CA - certificate authorities
root CA issues certs to intermediate CAs
child CAs issue certs to devs/users

procedure for requesting cert registration
create pub/private key pair - openssl
create CSR - certificate signing request contains - purpose of cert,website info, public key, and requester
CSR formatted by public key encryption standards PKCS #10 - CA publishes cert template
CA validates requester id, creates cert with pub key
OIDs are used here to identify entities - specify ISO, id/not id,  IANA, and org specific trailer
RA can assist CA in large orgs by gathering info 

CRL - certificate revocation list
OCSP - onine cert status protocol - returns good revoked or unknown

certs use x.509v3 formats except revocation lists which use v2
certs stored as binary files or base64 ascii

DER certs are like ssh with ---begin and end--- header/footer
CER are binary encoded and don't have header/footer
PEM used for email only, but can be used for anything.  can be cer or der, 
pem holding pub key typically uses .cer or .crt, priv key uses .key
p7b use der for pub key, can contain cert chain or CRL
p12 use cer for priv key, commonly encrypted, can contain cert cahin
